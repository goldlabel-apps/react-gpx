    GPX, or GPS Exchange Format, is an XML schema designed as a common GPS data format for software applications. It can
    be used to describe waypoints, tracks, and routes. The format is open and can be used without the need to pay
    license fees. Location data (and optionally elevation, time, and other information) is stored in tags and can be
    interchanged between GPS devices and software. Common software applications for the data include viewing tracks
    projected onto various map sources, annotating maps, and geotagging photographs based on the time they were taken.
